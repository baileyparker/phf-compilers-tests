# Test Harness for 601.[346]28 Compilers ðŸŽ‰

**A crowdsourced collection of test cases for @phf's compiler's course.**


## How Do I Use It?

```
$ git clone https://github.com/baileyparker/phf-compilers-tests integration_tests
$ ./integration_tests/bin/run_harness
```

The second command will run the test harness against the `./sc` compiler. If
you can't run your compiler with `./sc` from the current directory you can
pass in the `SC` environment variable to let the tests know where your
compiler is:

```
$ SC=../../path/to/my/sc ./integration_tests/bin/run_harness
```

For convenience, I recommend adding a target to your `Makefile` to run this:

```
integration-test:
	./integration_tests/bin/run_harness

.PHONY: integration-test
```

Don't forget if you've cloned this repo into your own repo (for versioning
your compiler) to add `integration_tests/` to your `.gitignore`.


### Getting the Latest Test Cases

This repo's `master` should always be safe, so you can just pull:

```
$ git -C 'integration_tests' pull origin master
```


## Contributing New Test Cases

You are too kind ðŸ˜„! The process is pretty straightforward (it's the standard
[open source pull request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)
workflow):

  1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/baileyparker/phf-compilers-tests)
  2. `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/phf-compilers-tests`
  3. Create a branch describing the test cases you're adding:
     `git checkout -b bogosort-scanner-fixture`
  4. Add, commit, and push your changes: `git add simple_test/fixtures`,
     `git commit -m "Add bogosort scanner fixture"`,
     `git push origin bogosort-scanner-fixture`
  5. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
     from Github

### Structure of Test Cases

There are fixtures in `simple_test/fixtures`. A fixture is a pair of two files
that provide input to the compiler and describe the expected output:

  1. A `*.sim` file (called the **input file**) that will be given to the
     compiler under test
  2. A `*.{scanner}` file (called the **phase file**) that described what the
     expected output of running the compiler under test in the phase described
     by its file extension against the `*.sim` file of the same name

In a line (*if you trust your compiler!*), a fixture for the scanner can be
created like so (assuming `quicksort.sim` exists):

```
./sc -s simple_test/fixtures/quicksort.sim 2>&1 > simple_test/fixtures/quicksort.scanner
```

Notice how the name of the files (without the extension) matches. This is how
the test harness knows to feed the input sim file in to the compiler under test
and expect the output `*.scanner` file. The test harness derives the phase to run
the compiler in from the extension of the second file, currently the phases are:

  - `*.scanner` - `./sc -s`

More will be added with future assignments.

Note that one input `*.sim` file can have multiple expected outputs for
different compiler phases (ex. `random.scanner` and `random.parser` are two
phase files that describe the expected output for `./sc -s`, the scanner, and
`./sc -c`, the parser, respectively when given the input `random.sim`).

The second file should contain both the expected stdout and stderr from running
the simple compiler on the input `*.sim` file. An example of this file is:

```
identifier<ics142>@(4, 9)
:@(10, 10)
ARRAY@(12, 16)
integer<5>@(18, 18)
OF@(20, 21)
identifier<INTEGER>@(23, 29)
;@(30, 30)
eof@(32, 32)
```

Lines in this file that begin with `error: ` are not expected to be present in
stdout. Instead, it signals to the test harness that the compiler should print
at least one error to stderr. Note that while we can append a description to
these error lines (to make the fixture clearer to anyone reading it to
understand why their compiler fails for it), the test harness will not check if
the line exactly matches.

So a `foobar.scanner` file like this:

```
identifier<ics142>@(4, 9)
:@(10, 10)
error: bad character ';' at line 1, col 11
```

Will accept output from the simple compiler under test with a different message
(as long as the error is in the same place):

```
identifier<ics142>@(4, 9)
:@(10, 10)
error: unexpected `;`@(11, 11)
```

The test will fail though if the output looks like this (note how the error is
too early):

```
identifier<ics142>@(4, 9)
error: unexpected ';' at (11, 11)
```

### Running the Test Harness Tests

To ensure a bug free harness, I've written tests for the test harness itself
(I know, [so meta](https://www.xkcd.com/917/), right?). To run them, you need
[pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) to pull in the required dependencies (a
simple `python3 -m pip install pipenv` should suffice, although you may need
to `sudo apt install python3-pip` first).

To run the tests:

```
$ pipenv run python3 setup.py test
```

In a very opinionated new pattern that I'm trying, linting and mypy static
checks are two of the test cases. If the code fails typechecking or linting,
the tests fail.

To get test coverage reports:

```
$ pipenv run python3 setup.py coverage
```


## Requirements

  - Peter's Lubuntu VM (Lubuntu 16.04)
  - Python 3.5 (already on the VM)
  - Pipenv (to run the meta tests, the tests that test the test harness)
